# taskmanager

I developed a task management app with secure user authentication, OTP-based password recovery, and versatile task management features. The app integrates REST APIs to efficiently manage tasks across different statuses (new, in progress, completed, canceled), with options for task editing and deletion. The user interface is designed to be intuitive and visually appealing, enhancing the overall user experience.
